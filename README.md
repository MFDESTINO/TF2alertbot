# TF2panelbot
a bot that lights up 3 random panels from Meet the Spy

## TODO
- turn the all the panels from `src/base.png` image off (image editing)
- make all individual panels and put them in `src/panels` (image editing)
- implement a mechanism to never repeat output images (maybe create a pool of valid available sequences)

## Dependencies:
- Python >=3.8
- Pillow >=6.2.1

# TF2panelbot
a bot that lights up 3 random panels from Meet the Spy

## TODO
- ~turn the all the panels from `src/base.png` image off (image editing)~
- ~make all individual panels and put them in `src/panels` (image editing)~ special thanks to Sion Worley for rendering the panels in SFM, saved a ton of work
- implement a mechanism to never repeat output images (maybe create a pool of valid available sequences) ***in progress***
- publish the bot

## Dependencies:
- Python >=3.8
- Pillow >=6.2.1
